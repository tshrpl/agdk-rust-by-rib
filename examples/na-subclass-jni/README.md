This is a minimal test application similar to `na-mainloop` that
demonstrates running with a subclass of `NativeActivity` and overriding
the `onNewIntent` `Activity` method and notifying rust whenever it's called.

Note: unlike the `na-mainloop` example, this one can't be built via
`cargo apk` since it needs to compile some Java code.

# Gradle Build
```
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android

cargo install cargo-ndk

export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="path/to/ndk"
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -o app/src/main/jniLibs/  build

export ANDROID_HOME="path/to/sdk"
./gradlew build
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start -n co.realfit.nasubclassjni/.MainActivity
```
